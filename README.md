# survey-form-repo

I built this survey form for an exercice on freeCodeCamp.org. I ended up learning a few things i wasn't aware of like, for example, how to display a background-color OVER a background-image using the linear-gradient function. It was also a good opportunity to play with very simple validation tools (basically the ones provided by Html) like the pattern attribute and some regular expressions.
Overall, it was pretty interesting. I thought it would be a boring unsavory task but i actually had fun all along and ended up tired but satisfied. Again, it's just beginner stuff but sharing and writing about it is a pretty good motivationnal tool.
